This notebook recreates the Tonque experimental survey reported in 

>Wandsnider, L., Camilli, E.L., 1992. The Character of Surface Archaeological Deposits and Its Influence on Survey Accuracy. J. Field Archaeol. 19, 169â€“188. https://doi.org/10.2307/529977 

I use the `prospect` Python package to simulate the survey under multiple scenarios. The simulations have already been run and saved to disk, so those can be loaded to explore existing results. 

If you'd like to experiment with changes, you can set the variables that start `LOAD_* = None` to re-run the full simulations.
